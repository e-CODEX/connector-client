/**
 * The DefaultWsCallbackHandler class is an implementation of the CallbackHandler interface. It
 * provides a default implementation for handling callbacks in web service clients.
 *
 * <p>When invoked, the DefaultWsCallbackHandler logs a trace message with the callbacks that were
 * received.
 * It does not perform any further action and is intended to be used as a placeholder or default
 * callback handler.
 *
 * <p>This class is typically used in conjunction with the JAX-WS framework to configure and create
 * web service clients.
 * It can be provided as the callback handler when setting up a JAX-WS endpoint or client, and will
 * be called with the appropriate callbacks during the web service invocation process.
 *
 * <p>It is important to note that the DefaultWsCallbackHandler class does not provide any
 * functionality
 * beyond logging the received callbacks. If custom callback handling logic is required, a different
 * implementation of the CallbackHandler interface should be used instead.
