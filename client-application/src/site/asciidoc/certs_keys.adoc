== Certificates, Keys and Keystores required
This guide explains the certificates and keys required for the client-application to communicate with the ecodex-connector.

This guide will *NOT* cover how keypairs and stores are created. Please refer to the web documentation on how to create keypairs and Java-Keystores (JKS).

=== Required keypairs
To connect a connector-client as a backend to an ecodex-Connector 2 keypairs are required:
* *ecodex-connector backend keypair* This keypair must be configured on the backend side of the ecodex-connector. Details on how to do this are described in the documentation of the ecodex-connector. In the picture above this keypair is described as "Private/Public Key Connector backend". For the connector-client only the public key of this keypair is required.
* *connector-client keypair* This keypair is completely to be generated and used for the connector-client. It may be self-signed. It is described in the picture above as "Private/Public key connector client". the public key of it must be configured on the backend side of the ecodex-connector. Details on how to do this are described in the documentation of the ecodex-connector. For the connector-client the private key of this keypair is required.

=== Required keystore
To be able to use the described keys, it is necessary to pack them into a keystore. This keystore must be a Java Keystore (JKS). One keystore for both, the public key of the connector's backend and the private key of the connector-client is sufficient. Inside the keystore, the keys are named with alias' which are required for configuration.

=== Configuration
How to configure the keys and keystore for the connector-client is described in the link:config_guide.html[configuration guide].
