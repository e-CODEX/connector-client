The client-application consists of the following modules:

* client-app-api
* client-app-controller
* client-app-fs-storage
* client-app-rest-api
* client-app-starter
* client-app-ui
* client-app-war

Additionally, the client-application uses the libraries that are contained in the client-libraries package.


=== client-app-api

==== Description
Over the whole client-application, a common API defines interfaces that are used by the modules to communicate with each other. Those interfaces can be implemented/overridden by developers in case some modules are replaced by customized ones. An example is that some implementer does not want to use the client-app-fs-storage to store messages in a file system, but has some other storage solution that should be used. All interfaces are well described in the link:apidocs/index.html[API docs,window=_tab] of this package.
This overview picture above as well as all architecture images only contain the interfaces that are used within the environment that is pictured.

=== client-app-controller

==== Description
The controller is the module that knows all the other modules. The main features of the controller are:

* It loads the embedded database used by the connector-client and holds the model of this database. This database is stored in a file that can be configured.
* It controls the usage of the connector-client libraries used to communicate with the ecodex-connector.
* The controller communicates with the storage module.
* The default implementation of the REST services provided by the client-app-rest-api is also part of the controller.
* There are 2 additional timer jobs within the controller:
** AutoConfirmMessagesJob queries the database if messages that have been received have not been confirmed yet. For the resulting messages the job triggers the ecodex-connector to produce and send such a confirmation.
** UpdateStorageStatusJob validates if messages that are stored in the database of the connector-client still exist in the storage by consulting the storage module and updates the storage status of messages within the database.
* Triggered by configuration, the controller at startup provides a service that restores the connector-client database if the database file is lost or damaged with information provided by the storage module.

=== client-app-fs-storage

[#img-client-app-fs-storage]
[link=../resources/images/domibusConnectorClientFSStorage.png,window=_tab]
image:domibusConnectorClientFSStorage.png[client-app-fs-storage,300,200]

==== Description
This standard storage module provided by the client-application stores and reads messages and their files from a filesystem. To be able to do so, the module has many default injected properties that can be overridden in the property configuration.

=== client-app-rest-api

Diagram: client-app-rest-api
[#img-client-app-rest-api]
[link=../resources/images/domibusConnectorClientRestAPI.png,window=_tab]
image:domibusConnectorClientRestAPI.png[client-app-rest-api,300,200]

==== Description
* *DomibusConnectorClientRestAPI* 
** Allows other applications to use functionalities of the client. It also provides the interface the client-application-ui uses. That way, implementers can develop their own user interface for the connector-client. A prominent example is the Central Testing Platform (CTP) of e-CODEX.
* *DomibusConnectorClientMessageRestAPI* 
** Interface provided as a REST service to let backend applications pull messages and confirmations from the client-application.
* *DomibusConnectorClientSubmissionRestAPI* 
** Interface provided as a REST service to let backend applications push messages or trigger confirmations to the client-application.
* *DomibusConnectorDeliveryRestClientAPI* 
** Interface implemented as a REST client. If a backend application provides a REST service that implements the methods of this interface, the client-application can push new messages and confirmations towards this REST service. Requires additional configuration properties described in the link:config_guide.html[configuration guide].

=== client-app-starter

[#img-client-app-starter]
[link=../resources/images/domibusConnectorClientStarter.png,window=_tab]
image:domibusConnectorClientStarter.png[client-app-starter,300,200]

==== Description
The client-app-starter is just a module to start the spring boot application context and set the properties file.

=== client-app-ui

==== Description
This module contains all necessary classes and configuration to build the user interface of the client-application

=== client-app-war

==== Description
In this module there is only a starter class that enables the client-application to run and be loaded properly in a servlet container. It also builds the WAR file that is distributed in the deployable package.
