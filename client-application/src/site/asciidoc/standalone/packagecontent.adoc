=== standalone scripts
Scripts for launching the standalone application are located in the *standalone* folder after extraction:

* *start.bat* -This file starts the connector-client application in an MS-Windows environment. It checks, if the *JAVA_HOME* environment variable is set, sets the *classpath* environment variable to */bin* and */lib* and starts the application.
* *start.sh* -This file starts the connector-client application in a UNIX based environment (linux and other derivatives). It demands as a precondition that JAVA is properly configured, the JAVA executable is on the *PATH* environment variable, sets the *classpath* environment variable to */bin* and */lib* and starts the application.


=== config folder
This folder contains the following files:

* *connector-client.properties*	- properties file containing the most essential properties for the connector-client application as examples. For further details, please refer to the link:../config_guide.html[configuration guide].
* *log4j2.xml* - XML file defining the logging. It is preconfigured so that LOG files will be put in the "logs" subfolder.

=== database folder
Using the standard configuration delivered with this package, this subfolder will contain the embedded database for the connector-client application. Though empty, the database files will be created at first startup.


=== lib folder
This folder is part of the *classpath* configured in the startup scripts described above. If your connector-client application requires other libraries than those delivered, they can be placed here.

=== logs folder
Empty folder prepared for log files that will be generated. Only relevant, when using the standard configuration.

=== messages folder
Also empty in the beginning. Messages that will be received by the connector-client, or generated using the connector-client will be stored here. In the standard configuration this is the storage used by the client-app-fs-storage.
