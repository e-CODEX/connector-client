== The connector-client as an e-CODEX building block

The connector-client is a possibility for e-CODEX participants to support the connection to the backend of the ecodex-connector. The architecture of the e-CODEX building blocks shows where the connector-client is placed:

== Distribution packages

=== The connector-client offers 3 different options
* *client-libraries* is a distribution package for developers that may use different libraries in their custom backend application to have support in connecting to the ecodex-connector, send and receive messages and having timer-jobs available to actively pull message from the ecodex-connector or trigger the backend application to send new messages to the ecodex-connector. Details on this distribution package can be found at the link:client-librairies/index.html[client-libraries documentation site].
* *client-application* is the client application that runs out of the box. Depending on its configuration it can be used as a standalone application to send and receive messages without having a custom backend application (yet). As a generic client, it is independent of any e-CODEX use case. Details on this distribution package can be found at the link:client-application/index.html[client-application documentation site].
* *client-app-ui* is a user interface developed to interact with the client-application over a REST service. It is an own application besides the client application itself.
